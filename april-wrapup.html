			<h5>MAY WRAP UP</h5>
			<h2>I read the entire Shadowhunters series in one month</h2>
			<h3>MAY 2, 2020</h3>

			<div class="review">
				<p>
					This month, I ended up reading 35 books: 5 novellas, 13 comics, and 17 novels. Almost all of them were fantasy, which would have surprised me last year but isn't very shocking now. A year ago, I considered myself to be much more of a sci-fi fan, but tracking the books I have read in the last few months, it is very clear that fantasy has sneakily become one of my most-read genres.

				</p>
				<img src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1393658957l/18444207.jpg">
				<p>SYNOPSIS</p>
				<p>
					Featuring Hernandez's longtime Love and Rockets heroine Maggie, The Love Bunglers is tied together by the initial thread of the suppression of family history. Because these secrets can't be dealt with openly, their lingering effect is even more powerful. But Maggie's ability to navigate and find meaning in her life -- despite losing her culture, her brother, her profession, and her friends -- is what's made her a compelling character. After a lifetime of losses, Maggie finds, in the second half, her longtime off and on lover, Ray Dominguez. In taking us through lives, deaths, and near-fatalities, The Love Bunglers encapsulates Maggie's emotional history as it moves from resignation to memories of loss, to sudden violence (a theme in this story) and eventually to love and contentment. Much like what John Updike created in his four Rabbit novels, Jaime Hernandez has been following his longtime character, Maggie, around for several decades, all of which has seemed to be building towards this book in particular.

				<p>SYNOPSIS</p>
				<p>
					Based on Madeleine Flores' popular webcomic, Help Us! Great Warrior is about a very powerful (but deceptively tiny) Great Warrior who protects her village from evil-doers and looks rad while doing it! Possessing great strength and even greater self-confidence, she's ready to kick some butts and save everyone, especially hunks/pals/handsome skeletons. But Great Warrior has a secret...and will her friends stand by her side when they find it out?

					Madeleine Flores' tale of a smart, hilarious, and intensely capable little warrior has a unique sense of humor and manga-influenced look and feel, along with a great message for young readers. Excellent for fans of SMILE, LUMBERJANES, and EL DEAFO.
