			<p> 
				When I first started writing this post, I had just met my GoodReads goal of reading 150 books. I started writing this post over a month ago (yikes) and in that time I've read more than ten more books. I wanted to make a post celebrating all the great books I've read this year, but there are just too many to do them justice in this one blog post. So, instead of covering them all, I decided to just do the Mid Year Freakout Tag!

			<p>I have read so many beautiful, stunning books this year, but the one that stuck with me the most was <b>Hawkeye</b>.	I read the first two volumes in May after having it on my TBR for years.
				</p>
				<p> I had always heard amazing things about Aja and Fraction's work, and it definitely lived up to the hype! Their monochromatic color scheme, dynamic direction, and amazing composition blew me away. </p>
					<p>The story itself wasn't anything extraordinary: a superhero fighting bad guys while dealing with internal conflict is nothing new. But <i>the way</i> this story was told felt revolutionary. 
					</p>
					<p>I've heard many comic artist highlight this series as points of personal inspiration, and I completely understand where they are coming from. If you are at all interested in dynamic visual storytelling, I highly recommend these comics!
			</p>

				<p>
					<b>Synopsis:</b> The breakout star of this summer's blockbuster Avengers film, Clint Barton - aka the self-made hero Hawkeye - fights for justice! With ex-Young Avenger Kate Bishop by his side, he's out to prove himself as one of Earth's Mightiest Heroes! SHIELD recruits Clint to intercept a packet of incriminating evidence - before he becomes the most wanted man in the world. You won't believe what is on The Tape! What is the Vagabond Code? Matt Fraction pens a Hawkeye thriller that spans the globe...and the darkest parts of Hawkeye's mind. Barton and Bishop mean double the Hawkeye and double the trouble...and stealing from the rich never looked so good.

			<!--best sequel-->
			<p class="highlight"> best sequel you've read so far </p>
			<img class="textwrap2" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1533921102l/39988431._SY475_.jpg">
					<p> I started the Daevabad trilogy by S A Chakraborty in January and absolutely fell in love with the world, the characters, and the writing. However, because the books are such tomes (all well over 500 pages) I didn't think it would be a while until I continued the series. Ultimately, I only lasted a few weeks before succumbing to my desires and reading <b>The Kingdom of Copper</b>. </p>
					<p>This sequel took everything I loved from the first book and made me fall for them harder. The character development was completely stunning. The twists and turns had me on the edge of my seat for every single page. I haven't read too many sequels this year, but even if I had, I know this one would still be the best.
			</p>
			<div class="outer">
				<div class="inner">
						<p>
					<b>Because this is a sequel, the synopsis for Kingdom of Copper includes spoilers for the first book in the series. Therefore, I'm including the synopsis for the first book, The City of Brass, instead.  </b>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Synopsis:</b> Nahri is the best con woman on the streets of 18th century Cairo. But she knows better than anyone that the trade she uses to get by—palm readings, zars, healings—are all tricks, sleights of hand, learned skills; a means to the delightful end of swindling Ottoman nobles.
				</p>
				<p>
					But when Nahri accidentally summons an equally sly, darkly mysterious djinn warrior to her side during one of her cons, she’s forced to accept that the magical world she thought only existed in childhood stories is real. For the warrior tells her a new tale: across hot, windswept sands teeming with creatures of fire, and rivers where the mythical marid sleep; past ruins of once-magnificent human metropolises, and mountains where the circling hawks are not what they seem, lies Daevabad, the legendary city of brass, a city to which Nahri is irrevocably bound.
				</p>
				<p>
					In that city, behind gilded brass walls laced with enchantments, behind the six gates of the six djinn tribes, old resentments are simmering. And when Nahri decides to enter this world, she learns that true power is fierce and brutal. That magic cannot shield her from the dangerous web of court politics. That even the cleverest of schemes can have deadly consequences.
					After all, there is a reason they say be careful what you wish for...

			<!--new releases-->
			<p class="highlight"> new release(s) you haven't read yet, but want to </p>
			<p>There's no way I could only pick one book for this category, but I've wrestled it down to five from the dozens on my list.</p>
				<p>
					I'd love to say the reason why I haven't read these yet is due to libraries and bookstores being shut down, but obviously that hasn't stopped me from reading other books. Although these aren't at the top of my current TBR, I do think I'll get to these within the next few months.
				</p>

			<p><b>Big Black: Stand at Attica</b> by Frank "Big Black" Smith, Jared Reinmuth, and Ameziane</p>
			<img class="textwrap" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1566731892l/52385646._SX318_SY475_.jpg">
			<p>I have been super excited to read this graphic memoir about the historic Attica prison rebellion since before its release in February. I had been on my library's waitlist for weeks and was set to pick it up until the closures began due to the current pandemic. Unfortunately, my library still hasn't opened back up so I haven't been able to pick up what I know is an amazing book. But, I am very much looking forward to getting my hands on it whenever it is safe for me to do so!</p>
			<div class="outer">
				<div class="inner">
				<p><b>Synopsis:</b> In the summer of 1971, the New York’s Attica State Prison is a symbol of everything broken in America – abused prisoners, rampant racism and a blind eye turned towards the injustices perpetrated on the powerless. But when the guards at Attica overreact to a minor incident, the prisoners decide they’ve had enough – and revolt against their jailers, taking them hostage and making demands for humane conditions. Frank “Big Black” Smith finds himself at the center of this uprising, struggling to protect hostages, prisoners and negotiators alike. But when the only avenue for justice seems to be negotiating with ambitious Governor Nelson Rockefeller, Big Black soon discovers there may be no hope in finding a peaceful resolution for the prisoners in Attica.</p>

			<p><b>Sports is Hell</b> by Ben Passmore</p> 
			<img class="textwrap2" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1573864842l/48708304.jpg">
			<p>I am a huge fan of Passmore's work, from his anthology, <i>Your Black Friend and Other Strangers</i>, to his series, <i>DAYGLOAHOLE</i>. (All of his comics are sold through the independent comic publisher<a href="https://store.silversprocket.net/collections/ben-passmore">Silver Sprocket</a>.)
			His art style, use of color, and the way he connects out of this world concepts to social injustice make his comics some of my favorites. His new graphic novel is a commentary on sports culture, and although I own a copy and have had it for months, I still haven't picked it up. But, I will! Eventually...</p>
			<div class="outer">
				<div class="inner">
				<p><b>Synopsis:</b> Some wars are for religion and some are for political belief, but this one is for football. After her city wins the Super Bowl for the first time, Tea is separated from her friend during a riot and joins a small clique fighting its way through armed groups of football fanatics to met a star receiver that just might end the civil war or become the city's new oppressive leader.</p>

			<p><b>Riot Baby</b> by Tochi Onyebuchi</p> 
			<img class="textwrap" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1556633991l/43719523._SY475_.jpg">
			<p>I haven't read any of Onyebuchi's work before but I have always heard great things, and I'm told <b>Riot Baby</b> is one of the best sci fi novels. I've been disappointed in my most recent sci fi reads and the premise of this story sounds incredible, so I am very much looking forward to reading this novel in the near future.</p>
		
			<div class="outer">
				<div class="inner">
				<p><b>Synopsis:</b> A global dystopian narrative and an intimate family story with quietly devastating things to say about love, fury, and the Black American experience: Ella and Kev are brother and sister, both gifted with extraordinary power. Their childhoods are defined and destroyed by structural racism and brutality. Their futures might alter the world. When Kev is incarcerated for the crime of being a young black man in America, Ella—through visits both mundane and supernatural—tries to show him the way to a revolution that could burn it all down.</p>

			<p><b>The Henna Wars</b> by Adiba Jaigirdar</p>
			<img class="textwrap2" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1573648325l/44286258._SY475_.jpg">
			<p>I was first introduced to this novel through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEG27Q_1lqs"> Saajid of Books are my Social Life</a>: they actually released two separate videos to talk about all the amazing books they were excited for.</p> 
			<p>
				Since then, I have been super excited for this Muslim, enemies-to-lovers romance about two girls from competing henna businesses set in Ireland. I also like that there is an interracial romance where neither of them are white! From everything I've heard, this book is beautifully written and I know I'll read it soon! (I have it on hold from the library, so whenever they re-open...) AND THAT COVER: gorgeous!
			</p>
			<div class="outer">
				<div class="inner">
				<p><b>Synopsis:</b> When Nishat comes out to her parents, they say she can be anyone she wants—as long as she isn’t herself. Because Muslim girls aren’t lesbians. Nishat doesn’t want to hide who she is, but she also doesn’t want to lose her relationship with her family. And her life only gets harder once a childhood friend walks back into her life.
				</p><p>
				Flávia is beautiful and charismatic and Nishat falls for her instantly. But when a school competition invites students to create their own businesses, both Flávia and Nishat choose to do henna, even though Flávia is appropriating Nishat’s culture. Amidst sabotage and school stress, their lives get more tangled—but Nishat can’t quite get rid of her crush on Flávia, and realizes there might be more to her than she realized. </p>

			<p><b>Out Now: Queer We Go Again!</b> edited by Saundra Mitchell</p>
			<img class="textwrap" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1572645263l/52172088.jpg">
			<p>This book's predecessor, <i>Out Now</i>, is one of my favorite anthologies of all time. LGBT+ historical fiction is one of my absolute favorite genres, and that book introduced me to some of my favorite authors. So, of course, when I heard Saundra Mitchell was putting together a follow up book, I immediately added it to my list.</p>
			<p>
				Though, one of the reasons why I've been holding off on buying myself a copy is because I still want to buy my own copy of <i>Out Now</i>, and buying two hardcover books at once is a little outside my price range right now. (Plus, I'd much rather but the money towards more important funds.) But, I will be getting around to reading this at some point.
			</p>
			<div class="outer">
				<div class="inner">
				<p><b>Synopsis:</b> A follow-up to the critically acclaimed All Out anthology, Out Now features seventeen new short stories from amazing queer YA authors. Vampires crash prom, aliens run from the government, a president’s daughter comes into her own, a true romantic tries to soften the heart of a cynical social media influencer, a selkie and the sea call out to a lost soul. Teapots and barbershops, skateboards and VW vans, Street Fighter and Ares’s sword: Out Now has a story for every reader and surprises with each turn of the page!</p>

			<p><b>The Death of Vivek Oji</b> by Akwaeke Emezi</p>
			<img class="textwrap2" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1579616999l/48595550._SY475_.jpg">
			<p>I have read and adored everything Akwaeke Emezi has written, and I completely trust them to take me on whatever journey they write into their stories. Their first two books, <i>Freshwater</i> and <i>Pet</i>,challenged my sense of self, my relation to my community, and my view of the world, and I have no doubt their next book will also have such a profound impact on me. I can't wait for <b>The Death of Vivek Oji</b> to tear me apart and make me learn to peace myself backtogether, like each of their books have done before.

					<b>Synopsis:</b> One afternoon, in a town in southeastern Nigeria, a mother opens her front door to discover her son’s body, wrapped in colorful fabric, at her feet. What follows is the tumultuous, heart-wrenching story of one family’s struggle to understand a child whose spirit is both gentle and mysterious. Raised by a distant father and an understanding but overprotective mother, Vivek suffers disorienting blackouts, moments of disconnection between self and surroundings. As adolescence gives way to adulthood, Vivek finds solace in friendships with the warm, boisterous daughters of the Nigerwives, foreign-born women married to Nigerian men. But Vivek’s closest bond is with Osita, the worldly, high-spirited cousin whose teasing confidence masks a guarded private life. As their relationship deepens—and Osita struggles to understand Vivek’s escalating crisis—the mystery gives way to a heart-stopping act of violence in a moment of exhilarating freedom.

			<p><b>Darius the Great Deserves Better</b> by Adib Khorram</p>
			<img class="textwrap" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576517046l/49025767.jpg">
			<p><i>Darius the Great is Not Okay</i> is one of my favorite books of all time, and I was incredibly happy to hear that Adib Khorram made plans to continue Darius's story. Now that Darius has grown emotionally, he is more ready for romance, I am definitely ready to read all about it. My sweet, insecure boy now at the center of a love triangle? Of course I am counting down the days until this release! I also am excited to see more of Sohrab, hear more about Darius's love of tea, and see how he handles new insecurities since he tackled his old ones. This title already has me all soft and teary, because Darius really DOES deserve better.</p>
			<div class="outer">
				<div class="inner">
				<p>
					<b>Synopsis:</b> Darius Kellner is having a bit of a year. Since his trip to Iran this past spring, a lot has changed. He’s getting along with his dad, and his best friend Sohrab is only a Skype call away. Between his first boyfriend, Landon, his varsity soccer practices, and his internship at his favorite tea shop, Darius is feeling pretty okay. Like he finally knows what it means to be Darius Kellner.
				</p><p>
					Then, of course, everything changes. Darius’s grandmothers are in town for a long visit while his dad is gone on business, and Darius isn’t sure whether they even like him. The internship isn’t what Darius thought it would be, and now he doesn’t know about turning tea into his career. He was sure he liked Landon, but when he starts hanging out with Chip–soccer teammate and best friend of Trent Bolger, epic bully–well, he’s just not so sure about Landon anymore, either.
				</p><p>
					Darius thought he knew exactly who he was and what he wanted, but maybe he was wrong. Maybe he deserves better.

			<p><b>How it All Blew Up</b> by Arvin Ahmadi</p>

			<p>Although I haven't read any of Arvin Ahmadi's work before, I am still very excited for his next book. I haven't always loved coming-out stories in the past, but this story seems to promise a new perspective beyond those other books. Amir engages in different spaces differently and tries to separate his "old" life at home with his family from his "new" life in Italy. How he exists in these spaces is only further complicated by the way Islamaphobia makes travelling more difficult. I'm really interested to see how Ahmadi tackles all these ideas and to meet Amir!</p>
			<div class="outer">
				<div class="inner">
				<p>
					<b>Synopsis:</b> Eighteen-year-old Amir Azadi always knew coming out to his Muslim family would be messy--he just didn't think it would end in an airport interrogation room. But when faced with a failed relationship, bullies, and blackmail, running away to Rome is his only option. Right?
				</p><p>
					Soon, late nights with new friends and dates in the Sistine Chapel start to feel like second nature... until his old life comes knocking on his door. Now, Amir has to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth to a US Customs officer, or risk losing his hard-won freedom.

			<p><b>The Ever Cruel Kingdom</b> by Rin Chupeco</p>
			<img class="textwrap" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1581368147l/44648898.jpg">
			<p><i>The Never Tilting World</i>, the first book of this duology, was one of my favorite reads of 2019. It was the first book I have read by Rin Chupeco, and I have since become a huge fan. 
			</p><p>
			The way they built the romances, alternating POVs, and an environmentally damaged, magical world pulled me in immediately. I am super excited to see how they conclude this story, and I'm looking forward to reading so many more of their works in the future.</p>
			<p>I haven't purchased my own copy of <i>The Never Tilting World</i> yet, but I hope to do so soon so that I can keep this amazing duology on my shelves forever.</p>
			<div class="outer">

					<p>
					<b>Because this is a sequel, the synopsis for The Ever Cruel Kingom includes spoilers for the first book in the series. Therefore, I'm including the synopsis for the first book, The Never Tilting World, instead.  </b>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Synopsis:</b> Generations of twin goddesses have long ruled Aeon. But seventeen years ago, one sister’s betrayal defied an ancient prophecy and split their world in two. The planet ceased to spin, and a Great Abyss now divides two realms: one cloaked in perpetual night, the other scorched by an unrelenting sun.
				</p><p>
					While one sister rules Aranth—a frozen city surrounded by a storm-wracked sea —her twin inhabits the sand-locked Golden City. Each goddess has raised a daughter, and each keeps her own secrets about her sister’s betrayal.
				</p><p>
					But when shadowy forces begin to call their daughters, Odessa and Haidee, back to the site of the Breaking, the two young goddesses—along with a powerful healer from Aranth, and a mouthy desert scavenger—set out on separate journeys across treacherous wastelands, desperate to heal their broken world. No matter the sacrifice it demands.

			<p>Everything I know about this book, I love. I love the cover, I love the title, I love the ownvoices trans rep, and I love what I've heard of the story! I haven't read Zeyn Joukhadar's debut novel yet, but it seems incredibly powerful as well. 
			</p><p>
			Since the publishing date for <b>The Thirty Names of Night</b> was pushed back, I will definitely make sure to read his first book beforehand. Although they are both standalones and there is no need for me to read them in any specific order, I just want to read as much of Joukhadar's work as I can, as soon as I can!</p>

					<b>Synopsis:</b> Five years after a suspicious fire killed his ornithologist mother, a closeted Syrian American trans boy sheds his birth name and searches for a new one. He has been unable to paint since his mother’s ghost has begun to visit him each evening. As his grandmother’s sole caretaker, he spends his days cooped up in their apartment, avoiding his neighborhood masjid, his estranged sister, and even his best friend (who also happens to be his longtime crush). The only time he feels truly free is when he slips out at night to paint murals on buildings in the once-thriving Manhattan neighborhood known as Little Syria.
				</p><p>
					One night, he enters the abandoned community house and finds the tattered journal of a Syrian American artist named Laila Z, who dedicated her career to painting the birds of North America. She famously and mysteriously disappeared more than sixty years before, but her journal contains proof that both his mother and Laila Z encountered the same rare bird before their deaths. In fact, Laila Z’s past is intimately tied to his mother’s—and his grandmother’s—in ways he never could have expected. Even more surprising, Laila Z’s story reveals the histories of queer and transgender people within his own community that he never knew. Realizing that he isn’t and has never been alone, he has the courage to officially claim a new name: Nadir, an Arabic name meaning rare.
				</p><p>
					As unprecedented numbers of birds are mysteriously drawn to the New York City skies, Nadir enlists the help of his family and friends to unravel what happened to Laila Z and the rare bird his mother died trying to save. Following his mother’s ghost, he uncovers the silences kept in the name of survival by his own community, his own family, and within himself, and discovers the family that was there all along.

			<p>I really wanted to like the <b>Meet Cute</b> anthology; I hoped I would love it. But I did not like it at all. And what's even worse, I gifted this book to a friend before I read it (so sorry)! I had expected sweet, fun stories and instead was just super bored.</p>
			<p>Usually, when I read anthologies, I enjoy how short each story is. But for these, they were way too short for me to be invested in any of the characters or their relationships. And even though the length did feel like a problem, the writing was so uninteresting that I probably would have dnfed them if they were any longer.</p>
			<p>I thought I really liked meet cutes before this, but not I'm wondering if that is actually true. Even if their first meeting is cute, I need more yearning, pining, emotional development, intimacy, and attachment to actually care about a couple.</p>

			<p>After wanting to read his graphic novels for years, I was gifted the first two volumes of Otava Heikkilä's <i>Letters for Lucardo</i> series. It was no surprise to me how much I absolutely adored those erotic historical fantasy, but a few months later, I was completely surprised by the release of his newest comic, <b>Sasha from the Gym</b>. The comic is less than 100 pages, but the lineart and the attraction and the coloring and the relationship from two trans men with very different gender experiences and senses of style and everything else about this comic completely blew my mind! If I hadn't already been a fan of Heikkilä's work, this definitely cemented that fact and made me even more excited for everything he will create in the future.</p>

					2000. Bright, ambitious, and yearning for adulthood, fifteen-year-old Vanessa Wye becomes entangled in an affair with Jacob Strane, her magnetic and guileful forty-two-year-old English teacher.
				</p><p>
					2017. Amid the rising wave of allegations against powerful men, a reckoning is coming due. Strane has been accused of sexual abuse by a former student, who reaches out to Vanessa, and now Vanessa suddenly finds herself facing an impossible choice: remain silent, firm in the belief that her teenage self willingly engaged in this relationship, or redefine herself and the events of her past. But how can Vanessa reject her first love, the man who fundamentally transformed her and has been a persistent presence in her life? Is it possible that the man she loved as a teenager—and who professed to worship only her—may be far different from what she has always believed?
				</p><p>
					Alternating between Vanessa’s present and her past, My Dark Vanessa juxtaposes memory and trauma with the breathless excitement of a teenage girl discovering the power her own body can wield. Thought-provoking and impossible to put down, this is a masterful portrayal of troubled adolescence and its repercussions that raises vital questions about agency, consent, complicity, and victimhood. Written with the haunting intimacy of The Girls and the creeping intensity of Room, My Dark Vanessa is an era-defining novel that brilliantly captures and reflects the shifting cultural mores transforming our relationships and society itself.

					Snap's town had a witch. At least, that's how the rumor goes. But in reality, Jacks is just a crocks-wearing, internet-savvy old lady who sells roadkill skeletons online--after doing a little ritual to put their spirits to rest. It's creepy, sure, but Snap thinks it's kind of cool, too. They make a deal: Jacks will teach Snap how to take care of the baby opossums that Snap rescued, and Snap will help Jacks with her work. But as Snap starts to get to know Jacks, she realizes that Jacks may in fact have real magic--and a connection with Snap's family's past.

				</p><p>
					Felix Love has never been in love—and, yes, he’s painfully aware of the irony. He desperately wants to know what it’s like and why it seems so easy for everyone but him to find someone. What’s worse is that, even though he is proud of his identity, Felix also secretly fears that he’s one marginalization too many—Black, queer, and transgender—to ever get his own happily-ever-after.
				</p><p>
					When an anonymous student begins sending him transphobic messages—after publicly posting Felix’s deadname alongside images of him before he transitioned—Felix comes up with a plan for revenge. What he didn’t count on: his catfish scenario landing him in a quasi–love triangle....
				</p><p>
					But as he navigates his complicated feelings, Felix begins a journey of questioning and self-discovery that helps redefine his most important relationship: how he feels about himself.
				</p><p>
					Felix Ever After is an honest and layered story about identity, falling in love, and recognizing the love you deserve.

					<b>Synopsis:</b> When Rin aced the Keju—the Empire-wide test to find the most talented youth to learn at the Academies—it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials, who couldn’t believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rin’s guardians, who believed they’d finally be able to marry her off and further their criminal enterprise; and to Rin herself, who realized she was finally free of the servitude and despair that had made up her daily existence. That she got into Sinegard—the most elite military school in Nikan—was even more surprising. But surprises aren’t always good.
				</p><p>
					Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard. Targeted from the outset by rival classmates for her color, poverty, and gender, Rin discovers she possesses a lethal, unearthly power—an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of a seemingly insane teacher and psychoactive substances, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much alive—and that mastering control over those powers could mean more than just surviving school.
				</p><p>
					For while the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. The militarily advanced Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. And while most of the people are complacent to go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third Poppy War is just a spark away . . .
				</p><p>
					Rin’s shamanic powers may be the only way to save her people. But as she finds out more about the god that has chosen her, the vengeful Phoenix, she fears that winning the war may cost her humanity . . . and that it may already be too late.

					<b>Synopsis:</b> This is the way the world ends. Again. Three terrible things happen in a single day. Essun, a woman living an ordinary life in a small town, comes home to find that her husband has brutally murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter. Meanwhile, mighty Sanze -- the world-spanning empire whose innovations have been civilization's bedrock for a thousand years -- collapses as most of its citizens are murdered to serve a madman's vengeance. And worst of all, across the heart of the vast continent known as the Stillness, a great red rift has been been torn into the heart of the earth, spewing ash enough to darken the sky for years. Or centuries. Now Essun must pursue the wreckage of her family through a deadly, dying land. Without sunlight, clean water, or arable land, and with limited stockpiles of supplies, there will be war all across the Stillness: a battle royale of nations not for power or territory, but simply for the basic resources necessary to get through the long dark night. Essun does not care if the world falls apart around her. She'll break it herself, if she must, to save her daughter.

					<b>Synopsis:</b> Odd-mannered, obsessive, withdrawn, Aster has little to offer folks in the way of rebuttal when they call her ogre and freak. She's used to the names; she only wishes there was more truth to them. If she were truly a monster, as they accuse, she'd be powerful enough to tear down the walls around her until nothing remained of her world, save for stories told around the cookfire.
					</p><p>
					Aster lives in the low-deck slums of the HSS Matilda, a space vessel organized much like the antebellum South. For generations, the Matilda has ferried the last of humanity to a mythical Promised Land. On its way, the ship's leaders have imposed harsh moral restrictions and deep indignities on dark-skinned sharecroppers like Aster, who they consider to be less than human.
				</p><p>
					When the autopsy of Matilda's sovereign reveals a surprising link between his death and her mother's suicide some quarter-century before, Aster retraces her mother's footsteps. Embroiled in a grudge with a brutal overseer and sowing the seeds of civil war, Aster learns there may be a way off the ship if she's willing to fight for it.
